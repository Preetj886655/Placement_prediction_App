📊 Placement Prediction App
The Placement Prediction App is a web application that predicts student placement outcomes based on academic and skill-related inputs. Powered by Machine Learning and built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, the app provides a user-friendly web interface for seamless user interaction.

🔧 Features
User-friendly Web Interface: Simple and intuitive design built with HTML and CSS.

Input Fields: Enter details like CGPA, communication skills rating, technical skills, 10th and 12th percentages, Mini Project ,Major Project,Hackathon,Intership and more.

Real-time Predictions: Instantly predicts whether a student will be placed or not and with probability.

Machine Learning Model: Trained using supervised learning algorithms for accurate outcomes.

Cloud Hosting: Easily deployable on platforms on Render.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Flask

scikit-learn

Pandas / NumPy

HTML / CSS

VS Code (for code editing)

Cloud Platform (Render, Heroku, etc. for deployment)

💡 How It Works
User Inputs: The user enters academic and skill-related data through the web form.

Model Prediction: The app processes the input and uses a trained machine learning model to predict placement status.

Result Display: The prediction result (Placed / Not Placed) is displayed on the web page.
